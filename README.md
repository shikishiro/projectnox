## <h2 style="font-size: 24px">Introduction</h2>

Project Nox is an AI-powered chatbot created by Shiki Shiro. Initially conceived as a tool to assist Shiki during his tenure at the MDRRMO Atimonan Chapter, Nox was designed to generate reports and provide weather updates for public safety purposes. However, Shiki later repurposed the project to create a personal Discord AI bot, aiming to simplify tasks for himself and his friends.

Nox is powered by ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. It utilizes the ChatGPT API to provide smart and intelligent responses, enabling natural and engaging conversations within Discord servers.
